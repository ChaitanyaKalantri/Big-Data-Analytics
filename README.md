## Project: Role of Tourism on Economic Development
#### There were three main objectives of the project:
1. To find the effect of variation in tourism with respect to the economic development of different states within USA.
2. Develop a ***Recommendation System***.
  - Given the name of the place the user is visiting, the recommendation system would recommend the top 10 best places to visit in that particular state.
  - Given the name of the genre the user likes, the recommendation system would recommend the top 10 best places to visit throughout the USA.
3. Fetch real time data from ***Twitter API*** simultaneously, so that the present trend is also considered for the best results.
  
#### Size of the dataset: 30Gb

#### Technologies Used: 
- ***Pyspark***
  - Basic Libraries Used: pyspark, pandas, xlrd, 
  - Advanced Libraries Used: tkinter, PIL, tweepy, tweepy.streaming
- ***Amazon EMR***
  - To store the data, as performing any analytics on the local system was not possible because of the size of the data.
